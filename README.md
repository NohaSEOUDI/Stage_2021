# Project Title: Stage de Machine learning de reconnaissance de chiffres manuscrits à l’aide de Python et keras
**Project Description**

This project is a machine learning project that uses Python and Keras to recognize handwritten digits. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize handwritten digits and classify them into the correct digit from 0 to 9.
Technologies Used

   * Python
   * Keras
   * Jupyter Notebook

**Dataset**

The dataset used for this project is the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 images of handwritten digits. The dataset is split into 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
Installation

    Clone the repository
    Install the required dependencies 

**Usage**

    Open the Jupyter Notebook file in the project directory.
    Run each cell in order to train and test the model.
    Use the trained model to recognize handwritten digits by running the "predict_digit" function.
